In this project, you will find all the functions I did during my first year at Epitech.

The majority are functions of the <stdlib.h>, <math.h> and even <stdio.h> library that I recoded.

Also, I use multiple ways to structure the data like hash tables, linked lists, and binary trees.

To test my program:
"Make re" in a command terminal
